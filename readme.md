# Rotman MMA Datathon
Team 2 - Code for Project
### Usual Readme Stuff
... not yet written ...

### For Marco, from Simon
- I'll be working in the LM-Substitutes branch, so the master branch is all 
yours. 
- The data path to our data is ``data/mma_mart.csv`` for all my code, so if 
you place a copy of our data in the ``data`` folder everything should work 
splendidly.
- Some of the notebooks don't have good code comments because I either didn't 
get to them or gave up half way. However, the 
[baselines_and_metrics](baselines_and_metrics.ipynb) file should have everything
 you need.
- Have fun coding!
